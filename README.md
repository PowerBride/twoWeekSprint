## Getting the repository up and running

### Note
This project uses Gulp 4.0 to handle build tasks. You therefore will need the gulp 4.0 cli installed on your terminal to do anything:
```
# install Gulp 4 CLI tools globally from 4.0 GitHub branch
$ npm install gulpjs/gulp-cli#4.0 -g
```
### Start
1. NPM Install
2. Bower Install
3. Gulp build (requires Gulp 4 CLI)
4. Gulp watch to watch changes during development

## Gulp tasks
__gulp build__ Builds dev site

__gulp build production__ Builds production site

__gulp watch__ use during development for automatic incremental changes
